      <h1>Welcome,</h1>

      <p>
        I am a graduate Data Science student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, pursuing 
        the Computational Track with a strong foundation in mathematics and data engineering. My work 
        bridges analytical rigor with practical implementation transforming complex data into meaningful 
        insights that drive decision-making. With hands-on experience across data analysis, visualization, 
        and reporting automation, I take pride in designing solutions that are both technically sound and 
        business-focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed and applied skills in Python, SQL, 
        Tableau, and AWS to solve real-world problems. My projects span clustering algorithm design, association 
        rule mining, predictive modeling, and dashboard development each emphasizing interpretability and performance 
        optimization. Whether building a full-stack Django e-commerce application or optimizing SQL queries through 
        relational algebra, I focus on creating systems that are efficient, scalable, and intuitive to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        I approach data science as both an art and a discipline: uncovering patterns that inform smarter decisions, 
        while maintaining clarity, transparency, and accountability in every step of the process. My goal is to continue 
        refining my ability to design data solutions that not only explain what happened but also predict what comes 
        next bridging insight with foresight in a rapidly evolving data landscape.
