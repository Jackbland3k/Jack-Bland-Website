      <h1>Welcome,</h1>

      <p>
        I am a Data Science graduate student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), pursuing the 
        Computational Track with a <b>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from CUNY College of Staten Island</b> and 
        certifications in Data Mining and Big Data Engineering from Promineo Tech. My background combines 
        statistical data analysis, mathematical modeling, database engineering, and business-intelligence translating 
        complex datasets into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Technical Expertise:</b> I specialize in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), SQL (MySQL, query optimization, 
      database design, relational algebra), and data visualization tools (Tableau, Excel). My experience includes building 
      machine learning models, developing interactive dashboards, automating reporting workflows, and designing scalable data 
      pipelines using AWS. I have hands-on experience with statistical analysis, predictive modeling, clustering algorithms, 
      association rule mining, ETL processes, and relational database management. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Professional Background:</b> As an Internal Audit Intern at OceanFirst Bank, I analyzed audit data for SOX compliance, 
      validated financial datasets against regulatory standards, and delivered structured reports to stakeholders. At the Port Authority 
      of NY & NJ, I created data-driven workforce and operational reports that improved cross-departmental communication. Through Promineo 
      Tech's Data Engineering Bootcamp, I developed expertise in AWS-based data engineering, Python programming, and SQL optimization techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Analytical Approach:</b> I approach data science with both mathematical rigor and business focus-conducting exploratory data analysis to 
      uncover patterns, building predictive models that forecast future trends, and communicating findings through clear visualizations and 
      technical reports. My work emphasizes interpretability, performance optimization, and scalability. Whether designing 
      clustering algorithms, tuning machine learning models, or optimizing database queries, I focus on creating solutions that are 
      both technically sound and aligned with business objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Career Focus:</b> I am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Business Intelligence Analyst, Reporting Analyst, 
      or Database Engineer where I can leverage statistical analysis, machine learning, SQL optimization, and data visualization to solve 
      real-world business problems and drive data-informed decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Currently:</b> MS Data Science candidate at NJIT (Expected May 2026) | Open to internships starting January 2026 
      and full-time opportunities starting Summer 2026
