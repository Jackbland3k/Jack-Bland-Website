      <h1>Welcome,</h1>

      <p>
        I am a Data Science graduate student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), pursuing the 
        Computational Track (expected to graduate May 2026) with a <b>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from
        CUNY College of Staten Island</b> and certifications in Data Mining and Big Data Engineering from Promineo 
        Tech. My background combines statistical data analysis, mathematical modeling, database engineering, and 
        business-intelligence translating complex datasets into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
      I specialize in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), SQL (MySQL, query optimization, 
      database design, relational algebra), and data visualization tools (Tableau, Excel). My experience includes building 
      machine learning models, developing interactive dashboards, and automating reporting workflows. I have hands-on 
      experience with statistical analysis, predictive modeling, clustering algorithms, association rule mining, ETL processes, 
      and relational database management. 
      </p>

      <p>
      I approach data science with both mathematical rigor and business focus-conducting exploratory data analysis to 
      uncover patterns, building predictive models that forecast future trends, and communicating findings through clear visualizations and 
      technical reports. My work emphasizes interpretability, performance optimization, and scalability. Whether designing 
      clustering algorithms, tuning machine learning models, or optimizing database queries, I focus on creating solutions that are 
      both technically sound and aligned with business objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Business Intelligence Analyst, Reporting Analyst, 
      or Database Engineer where I can leverage statistical analysis, machine learning, SQL optimization, and data visualization to solve 
      real-world business problems and drive data-informed decision-making.
